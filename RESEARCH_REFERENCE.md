## PAZUZU MYTHOLOGY — Key Facts

**Source:** Wikipedia, Britannica, World History Encyclopedia

- **Full name:** Pazuzu (Akkadian: 𒀭𒅆𒊒𒍪𒍪, romanized: pà.zu.zu)
- **What he is:** Assyrian/Babylonian demonic deity, King of the Lilû (wind demons), son of Hanbi
- **Time period:** 1st millennium BCE, popular in Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods
- **Physical description:** Canine face, bulging eyes, scaly body, four wings, eagle talons, serpentine attributes. Head is hybrid of multiple animals — earliest known example of Mesopotamian iconography blending multiple animal and human features.
- **Dual nature:** 
  - DOMESTIC SPIRIT: Benevolent protector of households, infants, pregnant women
  - WIND DEMON: Controller of southwest winds bringing storms, drought, famine
- **Primary protective role:** Warded off the demoness Lamashtu (who preyed on unborn/newborn babies). His image on amulets was mass-produced in terracotta, bronze, iron, gold, glass, and bone.
- **How he was used:** Amulets hung in homes, worn as necklaces. Ritual texts prescribed Pazuzu heads to banish sickness. Spells and incantations invoked his protection.
- **His own words (from cuneiform texts):** "I am Pazuzu, son of Ḫanbu, king of the evil lilû-demons. I was enraged against the mighty mountains and ascended them." In another text he describes breaking the wings of other lilû demons to prevent them from causing harm.
- **NOT pure evil:** Unlike Christian reinterpretation (The Exorcist), in Mesopotamian belief he was a trickster-protector. You point the storm at your enemies. "To mistake Pazuzu for mere villainy is to miss the point."
- **Counterpart:** Egyptian demon Bes — both are protector demons in the home with similar iconography.
- **Visual motifs for app design:** Cuneiform inscriptions, stepped/zigzag geometric patterns (Mesopotamian art), lapis lazuli blue (Ishtar Gate), gold/bronze/terracotta colors, clay tablets, wing imagery, amulet shapes.

## KIKOPUP (EMILY LARLHAM) METHODOLOGY — Key Principles

**Source:** Dogmantics.com, progressivereinforcementtraining.com, Kikopup YouTube channel

### Progressive Reinforcement Training (PRT) Core Rules:
1. **No punishment, intimidation, or physical corrections** — ever
2. **Reward desired behaviors** with food, play, praise, or life rewards
3. **Tiny progressive steps** — break everything into the smallest possible increments
4. **Capture natural behaviors** when possible (e.g., capturing calmness)
5. **Criterion: 80% success over 3 sessions** before advancing — from applied behavior analysis standard
6. **Regression is normal** — going back a step is always good practice, never failure
7. **Short sessions** — 3-5 minutes optimal for retention. Multiple short sessions > one long session
8. **Train multiple different behaviors per day** for best engagement and retention
9. **The dog always has a choice** — if they move away, let them. Never force or restrain.
10. **Never use the dog's name negatively** — it should always predict good things

### Key Kikopup Concepts Referenced in App:

**It's Yer Choice (Impulse Control):** Hold treat in closed fist. Dog learns that backing off/looking away = reward. Never take the forbidden item as reward — always reward from OTHER hand.

**Capturing Calmness:** Reward the dog for naturally offered calm states. No cue, no prompting. You're reinforcing a state of being. Quiet marker, gentle treat delivery. Over time, do it on a mat to build mat = calm association.

**Positive Interrupter:** A special emergency sound (kissy noise, whistle) that means "stop everything and come get something AMAZING." Must be charged with 15-20+ pairings before testing. Must ALWAYS predict jackpot rewards. Never overuse or it loses power. Never use when dog is over threshold.

**Leave It vs Drop It:** Explicitly separated as different skills:
- **Leave It** = "don't touch it in the first place" (prevention)
- **Drop It** = "release what's in your mouth" (trade game — always trade UP, always give the toy BACK)

**Leash Walking (CONNECTED methodology):** Must be reliable INDOORS before outdoor proofing. Indoor LLW → Outdoor LLW is a hard prerequisite chain.

**Separation Training:** 
- Emily Larlham's advice from Dogmantics: "For dogs anxious about being alone, ignore him upon entering and leaving your house. Save hellos for later — e.g., half an hour after returning. This prevents creating a huge contrast between alone time and your arrival."
- Graduated departures: 1 second → 5 → 10 → 30 seconds → 1 min → 2 min → 5 → 15 min (hardest barrier) → 30 → 60+
- Fake departure cues: Put on shoes/coat but don't leave. Pick up keys, sit down. Desensitize the cues.
- Film the dog to watch for stress signals during absence
- First 15 minutes is the hardest part — most anxious responses occur within first 40 minutes
- Leave enrichment (Kong, puzzle toy) but note: truly anxious dogs won't eat when stressed

**Cooperative Care / Handling:** Based on Chirag Patel's Bucket Game + Kikopup protocols. Touch = treat, brief touch first, build duration. Always at dog's pace. If she moves away, PAUSE — never hold still or restrain.

### Skill Progression Pattern (consistent across all Kikopup skills):
1. **Capture or Lure** the behavior (no cue yet)
2. **Build reliability** (dog offers behavior consistently)
3. **Add verbal cue** BEFORE the behavior (word → behavior → mark → treat)
4. **Fade the lure** (smaller hand motion → empty hand → just the word)
5. **Add duration** (hold position longer before marking)
6. **Add distance** (further from you)
7. **Add distractions** (start easy, increase gradually)
8. **Proof in new environments** (lower criteria in harder contexts, rebuild)

## DOG ANXIETY SIGNALS — Body Language Reference

**Source:** AKC, VCA Animal Hospitals, Turid Rugaas (calming signals), Dogs Trust

### Calming Signals (Turid Rugaas identified 30+ signals):
Dogs use these to communicate discomfort AND to self-soothe. Context is key — these are only stress signals when they occur in inappropriate contexts.

| Signal | Description | Stress indicator when... |
|---|---|---|
| **Lip licking** | Quick tongue flick over lips | Not eating/drinking, in new situation |
| **Yawning** | Exaggerated, wide yawn | Not just waking up, tense face |
| **Panting** | Open-mouth breathing | Not hot or exercised, stiff drawn-back tongue |
| **Pacing** | Walking back and forth | Can't settle, no apparent purpose |
| **Trembling/shaking** | Full body shaking | Not wet, not cold, "shake off" after stress |
| **Whale eye** | Showing whites of eyes | Head turned but eyes watching fearfully |
| **Tucked tail** | Tail held low/between legs | In social or new situations |
| **Raised hackles** | Hair along spine stands up | Meeting new dogs, sudden stimuli |
| **Drooling** | Excessive salivation | Not near food, breeds that don't normally drool |
| **Scratching** | Sudden intense scratching | No apparent itch, in stressful context |
| **Hiding** | Going under furniture, behind you | When visitors arrive, loud noises |
| **Clingy/velcro** | Following room to room constantly | Pre-departure, new environment |
| **Freezing** | Sudden complete stillness | Mid-action, assessing danger |
| **Ground sniffing** | Sudden interest in ground | When approached by stranger/dog |
| **Turning away/head turn** | Deliberately looking away | When something approaches |
| **Low body posture** | Crouching, trying to appear small | New environments, loud noises |
| **Appeasement grin** | Showing teeth without aggression | Trying to defuse social conflict |
| **Ears pinned back** | Ears flattened against head | Fearful or submissive |
| **Avoidance** | Approach-retreat pattern | Wanting to investigate but afraid |
| **Reduced appetite** | Refusing treats/food | Normally food-motivated dog refuses |

### Separation Anxiety Specific Signs:
- Vocalization within minutes of departure (barking, howling, whining)
- Destruction focused on exit points (doors, windows) or owner possessions
- Elimination despite being house-trained
- Excessive greeting behavior on return
- Pre-departure anxiety (reacting to departure cues: keys, shoes, coat)
- Refusal to eat when alone
- Following owner room to room (velcro dog)
- Most anxious behavior occurs within first 20-40 minutes

### Departure Cues to Desensitize:
- Picking up keys
- Putting on shoes/boots
- Putting on coat
- Picking up bag/purse
- Opening/closing doors
- Starting car
- Saying specific goodbye phrases
- Specific time-of-day routines (morning work routine)

## ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES REFERENCE

### Categories (for logging):

**Food-based:**
- Kong (stuffed, frozen) — repetitive licking is calming
- Puzzle toys (Nina Ottosson, etc.)
- Lick mat (peanut butter, wet food, yogurt)
- Snuffle mat (hide kibble in fabric)
- Scatter feed (kibble scattered in grass)
- Busy box (treats hidden in cardboard boxes/containers)
- Muffin tin puzzle (treats under tennis balls)
- Frozen enrichment (frozen banana, pumpkin in molds)

**Physical:**
- Decompression walk / sniffari (dog-led, long-line, lots of sniffing)
- Flirt pole
- Tug play
- DIY agility (household items as obstacles)
- Swimming
- Fetch

**Sensory:**
- Novel surfaces (walk on different textures)
- Scent games / nose work
- Calming music (classical, reggae shown to be calming)
- New environment exploration

**Social:**
- Play with compatible dogs
- Positive visitor interactions
- Cooperative care practice

**Passive/Calming:**
- "Sit and watch the world" from porch/bench
- Chewing (bully sticks, appropriate chews)
- Quiet time on mat (capturing calmness)

### Key Enrichment Principle:
"It isn't enrichment if it happens every day" — variety and rotation are essential. If the dog gets frustrated, make the puzzle easier. Start simple, increase difficulty gradually.
